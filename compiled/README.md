###Instructions for installation: 

1. If you have a version of Keyconfig that is older than 20110522, upgrade to that version first. Upgrades from earlier versions may lose your key assignments.
2. Download the most recent XPI file from this folder.
3. Drag and drop the XPI file on top of Firefox?ThunderBird/SeaMonkey.
4. When prompted, choose to install the addon. 
5. BEFORE RESTARTING, be sure to disable any other version of KeyConfig.
6. Restart Firefox/Seamonkey/Thunderbird.
7. If this is an upgrade, open the config window (Ctrl-Shift-F12 or from the Addons tab) to make sure any old keybindings made it to the new addon.
