# dorando-keyconfig

A modified version of Dorando's tool to rebind keys in Mozilla apps. It is designed to be a drop-in replacement, and will keep your old settings. (See details for upgrade instructions.)

The official version currently does not handle custom JavaScript. Install the development version if you need this feature. 

[Official version available here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dorando-keyconfig/).

To install the development version, open the compiled folder and follow the instructions.
